The structural descriptors used here have been computed and published by [Zhao et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa931). 
Structural descriptors for 83 proteomes can be accessed [here](http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/DESCRIBEPROT/main.php) and are available for download. 
Here, we provide pre-processed files containing secondary structure predictions (PSIPRED) and disorder predictions (VSL2B) based on the data deposited in DESCRIBEPROT. The provided files are in json format and contain python dictionaries, with keys being UniProt IDs and the values being either sequence, secondary structure prediction or disorder propensity.  Files are provided for four organisms: 
- human
- mouse
- yeast (S. cerevisiae)
- E.coli
